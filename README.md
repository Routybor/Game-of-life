# Game of Life

Implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

## Usage
1) In logisim 2.7.1 open GameOfLife.circ
2) In missing library message press OK and select *CdM-8-mark5-reduced.circ*

## Note

Sometimes logisim incorrectly processes the value of some pins/wires/circuits. As a result, the game may not work correctly. To fix it, you need to repeat all the steps from above again(reopen project). Several reopenings may be required.
